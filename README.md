This was a collaborative coding project through Coding Temple, creating an interactive map of wifi hotspots in specific boroughs of New York City using Pandas and Folium.
The data source is https://opendata.cityofnewyork.us/data/, using the NYC Wi-Fi Hotspot Locations data set. I would love some suggestions on how to extend this into a Data Analytics project!
